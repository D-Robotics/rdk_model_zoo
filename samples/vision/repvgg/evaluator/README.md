# RepVGG evaluation
Use the bundled image for a single-image classification check. For dataset accuracy, prepare the matching validation set and per-image ground-truth class indices, then compare those indices with the runtime’s Top-1 class IDs.

<a id="dataset"></a>

## Dataset
The functional check uses the bundled test image. Dataset-level accuracy uses ImageNet ILSVRC2012 validation (50,000 images, 1,000 classes). Prepare a ground-truth mapping from each image to its zero-based model class index and compare it with the runtime’s Top-1 class ID. `datasets/imagenet/imagenet_classes.names` maps output indices to display names; per-image truth comes from the dataset annotations. See [ImageNet preparation](../../../../datasets/imagenet/README.md).

## Environment

Host: sample requirements (SciPy for source comparison). Board: matching X5 runtime environment described in the runtime README. Use the classification runtime below to collect results for evaluation.

<a id="command"></a>
## Commands

```bash
# cwd: repository root; expected: unittest OK, exit 0
python3 -m unittest discover -s samples/vision/repvgg/tests -v
```

Functional board check on the matching board:

```bash
# cwd: repository root
bash samples/vision/repvgg/model/download.sh x5 a0
python3 samples/vision/repvgg/runtime/python/main.py \
  --target x5 --variant a0 \
  --test-img samples/vision/repvgg/test_data/gooze.JPEG \
  --label-file datasets/imagenet/imagenet_classes.names
```

Repeat for each published variant on the matching board. For a same-board
comparison between runs, keep model bytes, image, resize type, Top-K and
scheduling parameters identical and compare class IDs and raw scores before
label formatting; expect identical IDs and scores within 1e-5. When a
Top-K boundary is an exact tie, compare per-ID scores instead of relaxing
the tolerance.

## Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Conditions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| contract pass | runtime accepts the artifact, tensor names/shapes/dtypes match the binding, one F32 score vector returns | prepared artifact on a matching X5 board |
| Top-K agreement | identical post-softmax Top-K class IDs across repeated runs of the same artifact; scores within 1e-5 | same board, same artifact bytes, image, resize type, Top-K |
| Top-1 accuracy | fraction of argmax-correct predictions over the prepared ImageNet ILSVRC2012 validation set | same artifact, same resize type and Top-K as the functional check |
| latency / FPS | inference timing on the matching board | compare with the published figures under [Reference results](#reference-results), measured under the conditions stated there |

<a id="outputs"></a>
## Outputs

Repeat the functional check on the matching board and compare with the published figures under [Reference results](#reference-results), using the measurement conditions stated there.

## Reference results

The table below is from the published source evaluator.

Source conditions: X5 CPU 8×A55@1.8GHz performance mode, BPU Bayes-e@1GHz. Float Top-1 is pre-quantization ONNX; Quant Top-1 is deployment. Single-thread latency is one frame/one BPU core; multi-thread latency and FPS use concurrent submissions. For a new comparison, use the same dataset subset and record warm-up, repetition count, board mode and concurrency settings.

| Model | Size | Params (M) | Float Top-1 | Quant Top-1 | Single-thread Latency (ms) | Multi-thread Latency (ms) | FPS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RepVGG_B1g2 | 224x224 | 41.36 | 77.78 | 68.25 | 9.77 | 36.19 | 109.61 |
| RepVGG_B1g4 | 224x224 | 36.12 | 77.58 | 62.75 | 7.58 | 27.47 | 144.39 |
| RepVGG_B0 | 224x224 | 14.33 | 75.14 | 60.36 | 3.07 | 9.65 | 410.55 |
| RepVGG_A2 | 224x224 | 25.49 | 76.48 | 62.97 | 6.07 | 21.31 | 186.04 |
| RepVGG_A1 | 224x224 | 12.78 | 74.46 | 62.78 | 2.67 | 8.21 | 482.20 |
| RepVGG_A0 | 224x224 | 8.30 | 72.41 | 51.75 | 1.85 | 5.21 | 757.73 |

In the published record the A0 quantized Top-1 (51.75) shows a substantial
drop from its float value (72.41); the published values are quoted as-is.
Rebuilding requires a separate accuracy check.

Description:
1. X5 is in the best state: CPU is 8xA55@1.8G, full core Performance scheduling, BPU is 1xBayes-e@1G, a total of 10TOPS equivalent int8 computing power.
2. Single-threaded delay is the ideal situation for single frame, single-threaded, and single-BPU core delay, and BPU inference for a task.
3. The frame rate of a 4-thread project is when 4 threads simultaneously send tasks to a dual-core BPU. In a typical project, 4 threads can control the single frame delay to be small, while consuming all BPUs to 100%, achieving a good balance between throughput (FPS) and frame delay.
4. The maximum frame rate of 8 threads is for 8 threads to simultaneously load tasks into the dual-core BPU of X3. The purpose is to test the maximum performance of the BPU. Generally, 4 cores are already full. If 8 threads are much better than 4 threads, it indicates that the model structure needs to improve the "calculation/memory access" ratio or optimize the DDR bandwidth when compiling.
5. Floating-point/fixed-point precision: Floating-point accuracy uses the Top-1 inference accuracy Level of onnx before the model is quantized, while quantized accuracy is the accuracy Level of the actual inference of the model after quantization.

## Dataset-level evaluation

For dataset Top-1 accuracy, pass each validation image to the runtime entry through `--test-img`, compare the returned Top-1 class ID with that image’s ground-truth model index, and divide correct predictions by the number of labeled images evaluated. Keep the artifact, resize mode, Top-K, board image and scheduling settings fixed when comparing runs. For latency or FPS, time the inference stage on the matching board and record the thread count and operating mode alongside the result.
