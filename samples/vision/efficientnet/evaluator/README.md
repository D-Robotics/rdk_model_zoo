# Model Evaluator

This directory records evaluation notes and validation references for the EfficientNet sample.

## Supported Models

| Model | Size | Classes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| EfficientNet-B2 | 224x224 | 1000 |
| EfficientNet-B3 | 224x224 | 1000 |
| EfficientNet-B4 | 224x224 | 1000 |

## Test Environment

- Platform: `RDK X5`
- Runtime backend: `hbm_runtime`
- Model format: `.bin`
- CPU: 8xA55@1.8GHz with full-core Performance scheduling
- BPU: 1xBayes-e@1GHz, 10TOPS equivalent INT8 compute

## Metric Description

- Float Top-1 is measured on the floating-point ONNX model before quantization.
- Quant Top-1 is measured on the quantized deployment model.
- Latency is the single-frame, single-thread, single-BPU-core inference latency.
- FPS is measured by multi-threaded task submission to keep BPU utilization high.

## Validation Summary

This sample is validated through the standardized Python runtime path:

- `runtime/python/run.sh`
- `runtime/python/main.py`

The sample prints Top-K classification results and saves the visualization image.
