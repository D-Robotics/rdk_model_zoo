## Introduction to YOLO

![](imgs/demo_rdkx5_yolov8n_seg.jpg)

YOLO (You Only Look Once), a popular object detection and image segmentation model, was developed by Joseph Redmon and Ali Farhadi at the University of Washington. Launched in 2015, YOLO quickly gained popularity for its high speed and accuracy.

 - YOLOv2, released in 2016, improved the original model by incorporating batch normalization, anchor boxes, and dimension clusters.
 - YOLOv3, launched in 2018, further enhanced the model's performance using a more efficient backbone network, multiple anchors and spatial pyramid pooling.
 - YOLOv4 was released in 2020, introducing innovations like Mosaic data augmentation, a new anchor-free detection head, and a new loss function.
 - YOLOv5 further improved the model's performance and added new features such as hyperparameter optimization, integrated experiment tracking and automatic export to popular export formats.
 - YOLOv6 was open-sourced by Meituan in 2022 and is in use in many of the company's autonomous delivery robots.
 - YOLOv7 added additional tasks such as pose estimation on the COCO keypoints dataset.
 - YOLOv8 is the latest version of YOLO by Ultralytics. As a cutting-edge, state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, YOLOv8 builds on the success of previous versions, introducing new features and improvements for enhanced performance, flexibility, and efficiency. YOLOv8 supports a full range of vision AI tasks, including detection, segmentation, pose estimation, tracking, and classification. This versatility allows users to leverage YOLOv8's capabilities across diverse applications and domains.
 - YOLOv9 introduces innovative methods like Programmable Gradient Information (PGI) and the Generalized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (GELAN).
 - YOLOv10 is created by researchers from Tsinghua University using the Ultralytics Python package. This version provides real-time object detection advancements by introducing an End-to-End head that eliminates Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) requirements.

## Original Processing Flow
![](imgs/YOLOv8_Instance_Segmentation_Origin.png)

## Optimized Processing Flow
![](imgs/YOLOv8_Instance_Segmentation_Quantize.png)

- In the **Mask Coefficients** section, two **GatherElements** operations are used to obtain the final valid Grid Cell's Mask Coefficients information, which amounts to 32 coefficients. These 32 coefficients are combined linearly with the Mask Protos part, or considered as a weighted sum, to derive the Mask information corresponding to the object in the Grid Cell.

Refer to the YOLOv8 Detect section documentation for the following:
- **Classify** part, **Dequantize** operation.
- **Classify** part, **ReduceMax** operation.
- **Classify** part, **Threshold (TopK)** operation.
- **Classify** part, **GatherElements** operation and **ArgMax** operation.
- **Bounding Box** part, **GatherElements** operation and **Dequantize** operation.
- **Bounding Box** part, **DFL**: **SoftMax + Conv** operation.
- **Bounding Box** part, **Decode**: **dist2bbox(ltrb2xyxy)** operation.
- **nms** operation.


## Steps Reference

Note: For any errors such as **No such file or directory**, **No module named "xxx"**, **command not found**, please carefully check and do not blindly copy and run the commands. If you do not understand the modification process, visit the developer community starting from YOLOv5 for more information.
### Environment and Project Preparation
- Download the ultralytics/ultralytics repository and follow the YOLOv8 official documentation to set up the environment.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics.git
```
- Navigate into the local repository and download the official pre-trained weights. Here, we use the 3.4 million parameter YOLOv8n-Seg model as an example.
```bash
cd ultralytics
wget https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v8.2.0/yolov8n-seg.pt
```

### Export to ONNX
- Uninstall the YOLO related command-line tool so that modifying the `./ultralytics/ultralytics` directory will take effect directly.
```bash
$ conda list | grep ultralytics
$ pip list | grep ultralytics # or
# If it exists, uninstall it
$ conda uninstall ultralytics 
$ pip uninstall ultralytics   # or
```
- Modify the output head of Detect to separately output the Bounding Box information and Classify information for each feature layer, resulting in six output heads.

File path: `./ultralytics/ultralytics/nn/modules/head.py`, around line 51, replace the `Detect` class's `forward` method with the following content.
Note: It is recommended to keep a backup of the original `forward` method, for example, rename it to `forward_`, to easily revert for training purposes.
```python
def forward(self, x):
    bboxes = [self.cv2[i](x[i]).permute(0, 2, 3, 1).contiguous() for i in range(self.nl)]
    clses = [self.cv3[i](x[i]).permute(0, 2, 3, 1).contiguous() for i in range(self.nl)]
    return (bboxes, clses)
```

File path: `./ultralytics/ultralytics/nn/modules/head.py`, around line 180, replace the `Segment` class's `forward` function with the following content. In addition to the detection part's six heads, there are three `32*(80*80+40*40+20*20)` mask coefficient tensor output heads, and one `32*160*160` base tensor used to synthesize the result.
```python
def forward(self, x):
    p = self.proto(x[0]).permute(0, 2, 3, 1).contiguous()
    mc = [self.cv4[i](x[i]).permute(0, 2, 3, 1).contiguous() for i in range(self.nl)]
    bboxes, clses = Detect.forward(self, x)
    return (mc, bboxes, clses, p) 
```

- Run the following Python script. If there is a **No module named onnxsim** error, install it.
```python
from ultralytics import YOLO
YOLO('yolov8n-seg.pt').export(imgsz=640, format='onnx', simplify=True, opset=11)
```

### PTQ Quantization Transformation
- Refer to the Tian Gong Kai Wu toolchain manual and OE package to check the model. All operators are on the BPU, so it can be compiled directly. The corresponding YAML file is located in the `./ptq_yamls` directory.
```bash
(bpu_docker) $ hb_mapper checker --model-type onnx --march bayes-e --model yolov8n-seg.onnx
(bpu_docker) $ hb_mapper makertbin --model-type onnx --config yolov8_instance_seg_bayese_640x640_nv12.yaml
```

### Remove Dequantize Nodes for Bounding Box and Mask Coefficients Output Heads
- Identify the names of the dequantize nodes for the three Bounding Box output heads
Through the logs generated when running `hb_mapper makerbin`, find that the three outputs with sizes `[1, 80, 80, 64]`, `[1, 40, 40, 64]`, and `[1, 20, 20, 64]` have the names 379, 387, and 395 respectively.
- Identify the names of the dequantize nodes for the three Mask Coefficients output heads
Through the logs generated when running `hb_mapper makerbin`, find that the three outputs with sizes `[1, 80, 80, 32]`, `[1, 40, 40, 32]`, and `[1, 20, 20, 32]` have the names `output0`, `output1`, and 371 respectively.

- Bin model after removing the target dequantization coefficients
```bash
hb_perf yolov8n_instance_seg_bayese_640x640_nv12_modified.bin
```
The following results can be found in the `hb_perf_result` directory.
![](./imgs/yolov8n_instance_seg_bayese_640x640_nv12_modified.png)

```bash
hrt_model_exec model_info --model_file yolov8n_instance_seg_bayese_640x640_nv12_modified.bin
```
You can see the input/output information of the bin model before removing the dequantization coefficients, as well as all dequantization coefficients after removing the dequantization nodes. This also indicates that these pieces of information are stored within the bin model, which can be obtained using the inference library's API, making it convenient for us to perform corresponding pre-processing and post-processing.

## Model Training

- Model training should refer to the ultralytics official documentation, which is maintained by ultralytics and is of very high quality. There are also numerous reference materials available online, and obtaining a model with pre-trained weights similar to the official ones is not difficult.
- Note that no modifications to any program code or the `forward` method are required during training.

Notes:  
1. The X5 is in its optimal state: CPU is 8 × A55 @ 1.8G with full-core Performance scheduling, BPU is 1 × Bayes-e @ 1G with a total equivalent int8 computing power of 10 TOPS.
2. Single-threaded latency is for a single frame, single thread, and single BPU core, representing the ideal delay for BPU inference of a single task.
3. Four-thread engineering frame rate is when four threads simultaneously feed tasks to the dual-core BPU. In general engineering scenarios, four threads can minimize single-frame latency while fully utilizing all BPU cores at 100%, achieving a good balance between throughput (FPS) and frame latency. X5 BPU overall is more powerful, generally 2 threads can eat BPU full, frame delay and throughput are very good.
4. Eight-thread extreme frame rate is when eight threads simultaneously feed tasks to the dual-core BPU on the X3, aiming to test the BPU’s extreme performance. Typically, four cores are already saturated; if eight threads perform significantly better than four, it suggests that the model structure needs to improve the "compute/memory access" ratio, or that DDR bandwidth optimization should be selected during compilation.
5. FP/Q mAP: 50-95 precision is calculated using pycocotools and comes from the COCO dataset. This can refer to Microsoft’s paper, and is used here to assess the degree of accuracy degradation for deployment on the board.
6. Run the following command to test the bin model throughput on the board
```bash
hrt_model_exec perf --thread_num 2 --model_file yolov8n_detect_bayese_640x640_nv12_modified.bin
```
7. Regarding post-processing: At present, the post-processing of Python reconstruction on X5 only requires a single-core single-thread serial about 5ms to complete, that is, it only needs to occupy 2 CPU cores (200% CPU usage, maximum 800% CPU usage), and can complete 400 frames of image post-processing per minute, and post-processing will not constitute a bottleneck.
