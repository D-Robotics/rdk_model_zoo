"""RDK S Ultralytics YOLO detection evaluation (compatibility wrapper).

The maintained implementation lives in the canonical sample at
`samples/vision/ultralytics_yolo/evaluator/eval_yolo_det.py`. This module forwards to
it from the RDK S tree, so the documented evaluation command keeps working
without a second copy of the metric code.

# The platform is resolved from the board, so S100, S100P and S600 select
# their own artifacts.
#
Usage:
    python3 eval_yolo_det.py --help

    """Locate the canonical Ultralytics YOLO sample above this file.

    The platform trees are distributions of the merged sample, so the
    canonical copy always sits at `<repo>/samples/vision/ultralytics_yolo`.
    Walking up to it instead of counting `..` keeps this working when the
    sample is moved, and turns a missing canonical sample into an explicit
    error instead of a confusing import failure.

    A directory only counts as the canonical sample when it carries the shared
    downloader, because every platform tree ends in the same
    `samples/vision/ultralytics_yolo` tail and would otherwise match first.

    Returns:
        Absolute path of the canonical sample directory.

    Raises:
        ImportError: If no parent directory holds the canonical sample.
